"""Arm A / Arm B: recompute the pre-registered RL arms from their eval rollouts.

REVISION_PACK sections G4 and G5 report two pre-registered probe-as-reward arms:

  A  reward = surface-RESIDUALISED probe, LR(h - s@B) over 39 text features
  B  reward = the 39 surface features ONLY; never reads the activation

and the claim rests on four first-block accuracies. Until 2026-08-12 nothing in
this repository could recompute them: the rollout JSONs lived only on the Modal
volume, so the two newest and most load-bearing results were the two nobody
could check. This script closes that.

Fetch the rollouts first (they are ~10 MB each and gitignored):

    modal volume get default-proj-training \\
        evaluation/eval_results/armA_residual_step100.json ./eval_armA_residual_step100.json
    modal volume get default-proj-training \\
        evaluation/eval_results/armB_surface_step100.json ./eval_armB_surface_step100.json

Then:

    python extension/probe/verify_residual_arms.py

Everything below follows the analysis fixed in PREREGISTRATION.md before the runs
and restated in HANDOFF.md, so none of it is a post-hoc choice:

  - primary outcome  first-block accuracy on the contamination-filtered clean-406
  - verifier         evaluation.countdown -- all numbers used exactly once,
                     arithmetic only, evaluates to target
  - intervals        prompt-clustered PAIRED bootstrap, 10,000 resamples

One population note the pack does not currently state, and should. The two arms
were evaluated at `--num_responses 8` while the two reference checkpoints were
sampled at 16, so an arm contributes 3,248 rollouts against a reference's 6,496.
The bootstrap pairs at the PROMPT level -- per-prompt mean accuracy, then the
difference of those means -- so the contrast is well defined regardless, and all
406 prompts are present on both sides. But the arms' per-prompt means are the
noisier ones, and a reader comparing raw rollout counts deserves to know why they
differ. This script prints the counts rather than hiding them.

Pure CPU, no GPU, no network beyond the two `modal volume get` calls above.

# INITIALISATION MATTERS MORE THAN THE TREATMENT, so the contrast must match on

# (= C_SFT; see HANDOFF.md and PREREGISTRATION.md). The "published
# probe-as-reward" run the pack compared them against is runA, which was
# initialised from C_outcome. That is a cross-initialisation comparison, and the
# paper's own numbers show initialisation is worth ~16 pp on its own: the SAME
# raw-probe reward gives 0.2361 from C_outcome (runA) and 0.0734 from C_SFT
# (runB). That is more than twice the effect being attributed to the treatment.
