# Related work and novelty assessment

Compiled 2026-08-02 from six parallel literature sweeps. **Everything here comes
from agent summaries, not primary reading.** Before committing to any framing,
read at minimum: Gupta & Jenner §5, Taufeeque et al. Eq. 3 and Table 4, Beigi et
al. (PRIME) §timing, and Yudelson's control-run methodology.

## The headline: what got claimed while this project was being planned

`CLAUDE.md` was written to answer "what happens mechanistically when a policy is
optimised against a correctness probe." **That question was answered by other
people between June 2025 and May 2026.**

| paper | venue | what it owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Gupta & Jenner, RL-Obfuscation** ([2506.14261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14261)) | Jun 2025 | The weights×text decomposition, **quantified: ~70% policy / ~30% representation**, by the same token-forcing logic we used |
| **Taufeeque, Heimersheim, Gleave & Cundy, The Obfuscation Atlas** ([2602.15515](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15515)) | **ICML 2026 (Oral)** | The formal three-term decomposition (Eq. 3) and the *obfuscated policy* vs *obfuscated activations* taxonomy |
| **Yudelson, Held-out Monitors Sometimes Degrade** ([LessWrong](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/APkFfRp2AicL9RqvT/)) | Jul 2026 | The policy term measured with the representation term structurally zeroed, plus a **no-proxy control run** |

Prior to those, the mechanism was already named: **Manheim & Garrabrant (2018)**
call it *Extremal Goodhart (Model Insufficiency)* — "selection pressure moves the
metric away from the region in which the relationship is most accurate so that
the relationship collapses." **Gao, Schulman & Hilton (ICML 2023)** assert it
empirically and use **answer length** as the worked example. **Laidlaw et al.
(ICLR 2025)** define reward hacking *as* distribution shift. **Karwowski et al.
(ICLR 2024)** give the occupancy-measure geometry.

## Scorecard

| our finding | status | who owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Probe-as-reward collapses monitor while accuracy falls | **partly open** | Nobody has shown it for a *correctness* probe as *positive* reward. The Atlas used a deception-probe *penalty* and accuracy went **up** (3.1% → 48%) — opposite sign |
| weights×text decomposition (~90/17) | **scooped** | Gupta & Jenner (70/30). Ours differs in domain and reward sign |
| the 4th cell: **tuned weights × base text** | **ours** | Both prior papers hold text at the *tuned* policy's outputs. Nobody scores base text under tuned weights |
| **~40-step lag: hacking onset → monitor discrimination loss** | **NOVEL** | Confirmed absent at survey level by [Fudan survey 2604.13602](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.13602). Gao et al. never plot proxy accuracy vs KL at all — only validation loss on a fixed t=0 set |
| retrained probe recovers | **contested** | Recovery: Wehner & Fritz, Duan (0.981). **Against**: Gupta & Jenner (near-null), Neural Chameleons (post-hoc probes on frozen post-evasion weights still fail), Atlas (continual retraining → no difference) |
| length/surface beats probe | **fragments** | Dutta (0.98 vs 0.998, 0.5B toy); Singhal (70–90% of RLHF gain is length); McKenzie (bag-of-words 88.9%) |
| regularisation buys delay | **contested** | Delay: Gao (KL ≈ early stopping), WARM ("delays the collapse"), Wolf. **Prevent**: Coste, Atlas (β=1e-1 → 100% honest). Neutral: MacDermott (KL has no consistent effect, sign flips) |

## The one strong result, and why nobody else has it

**Reward hacking precedes monitor discrimination failure by ~40 RL steps.**

Verified to be measured in the strong form: `auroc_frozen(t)` uses checkpoint
*t*'s own freshly sampled rollouts (each step reads its own `step_t.jsonl` from
its own model), on **126 held-out prompts**, with the frozen probe trained on a
**disjoint 300-prompt set** (overlap = 0, verified). This defeats the objection
that a static t=0 audit distribution would trivially fail to move
(Lamparth et al. Thm 3.9).

**Why the gap exists is structural and should be stated as part of the
contribution**: RM accuracy on the current policy distribution requires fresh
preference labels at every checkpoint. A *verifiable* correctness probe gives
AUROC free at every checkpoint. The affordance is the reason the measurement was
available to us and not to the RLHF literature.

**Positioning required:**
- **Baker et al. ([2503.11926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11926))** conflate the two
  events — their "recall falls to near zero" mixes *the agent evades* with *the
  monitor can no longer discriminate*, because they never hold out separate data.
  This is the cleanest one-sentence statement of our delta.
- **PRIME ([2606.09711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.09711))** reports a **~40-step
  lag of the same magnitude in the opposite direction** (internal precursor leads
  behaviour). Three separate reviewers flagged that readers will conflate them.
  Pre-empt in the intro.

## Three things that must be fixed before writing up

**1. No no-pressure control.** The Atlas finds representation drift occurs under
RLVR **with or without** a detector penalty. Yudelson found most monitors degrade
even in a control run and *subtracts* that degradation. Without a fixed-text arm
on the vanilla-RLOO ladder at matched KL, our 17% representational term is not
attributable to optimisation pressure. Flagged independently by three reviewers.
~$8.

**2. H2b — concept drift — was never in the hypothesis set.** The Atlas explains
its 0.991 → 0.376 collapse as *the model's beliefs about what counts as
deceptive changed* (undesired-answer rate 10–40% → 45–65%). That is neither H1
(information moved) nor H2 (information degraded). It is a third mechanism, and
`CLAUDE.md`'s protocol forbids adding hypotheses after seeing data. Record it as
a post-hoc addition, honestly labelled.

**3. Aggregation may dominate the Phase 3 zoo.** Gupta & Jenner: attention probes
and max-pooling are **robust (0.0–0.02 evasion)** while mean/median-pooled linear
and MLP probes are evadable (0.59–0.89). We tested only mean-pooled
single-position probes. Any H3 predictor must reproduce this or it is confounded.
ODIN's result is the one-line argument for why: decorrelating length moves
reward–length ρ from 0.451 → −0.05 at an RM accuracy cost of only 70.1% → 69.2%
— **in-distribution AUROC does not predict robustness.**

## Contrast cases worth confronting rather than hiding

- **Parekh, Drop the Act** ([2605.11467](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.11467v1)) — a
  frozen gated-attention probe used as an advantage *filter* holds **AUROC 1.000
  before, during and after** training. Filter-vs-reward and attention-vs-linear
  both plausibly explain the difference from our collapse. Separating them would
  itself be a result.
- **Wu & Tang** ([2604.01476](https://arxiv.org/html/2604.01476)) — concept
  directions at cosine **≥0.99** with base after RL. Independent support for a
  small representation term.
- **Anthropic, Recommendations for Technical AI Safety Research Directions** —
  verbatim: *"there is substantial risk that activation monitors are not robust to
  distributional shifts."* They flag the worry and propose no experiment. Our
  decomposition is a direct answer to a named open problem.

## The methodological claims, checked separately

A seventh sweep covered concept erasure, probing methodology, mech interp, fMRI
confound regression, and econometrics.

**Variance-matched residualisation controls: the currency change is genuinely
absent — but the phenomenon is not.**

Every removal control found in every field is matched on **rank, count, degrees
of freedom, spectrum, or norm**. Never on removed variance. Zero hits for
"variance-matched control" or equivalents in arXiv metadata.

But **do not write "nobody noticed this"** — it is falsifiable and will be
punished. That random removal costs little is in print repeatedly and unremarked:
LEACE ("erasing a randomly selected subspace has little to no effect"), Tigges
(<1%), ITI (0.7pp), and Amnesic Probing's own Table 1 at low rank. Bright &
Murphy (2015, *NeuroImage*) state the failure mode outright: *"any group of
regressors that randomly sample variance may remove highly structured 'signal'
as well as 'noise'."*

**The near-scoop, which must be cited**: Haghighatkhah et al. (EMNLP 2022,
[2212.04273](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04273)) sample random directions
**variance-weighted from the data's PC spectrum**, run 500 draws with CIs, and
conclude *"the improvement in similarity scores are due to reducing dimensions in
general rather than removing (partial) representations of gender"* — our
conclusion, in word embeddings, with a count-matched design.

**Elazar et al. flagged the gap themselves, twice**: *"the number of classes in
those experiments might be a factor… While not part of this study, it would be
interesting to control for this factor in future work."* They frame the
alternative as *rank*-reduction, never variance.

Defensible formulation: **report removed-variance fraction alongside every
ablation, and match the control on that quantity rather than on rank.** A
protocol fix, not a discovery. Distinguish explicitly from three things reviewers
will raise: LEACE's minimality theorem (a better *treatment*, not a null),
causal scrubbing's "ablations remove variation" (about the treatment), and
Rozanova et al.'s "run more random draws" (fixes the control's *variance*, not
its *calibration*). Cite **Elsayed & Cunningham (2017, Nat. Neuro.)** — nulls for
high-dimensional population data must be matched on second-order statistics — so
the idea reads as a principled import rather than an ad-hoc complaint.

**The other methodological claims:**

- **CKA blindness — drop it.** It is Kornblith et al.'s own Eq. 14, presented as
  a *design goal*, and published as a critique by Ding et al. (NeurIPS 2021),
  who use probing accuracy as the readout. Reframe our CKA number as the
  *global-drift null* it was always meant to be.
- **Frozen-threshold TPR — keep, reframed.** TPR@1%FPR is already the field
  convention (Goldowsky-Dill et al. 2025). The surviving point is sharper: *every*
  ROC-family metric, including that one, is equally invariant to monotone
  recalibration, because it re-derives its threshold from the current
  evaluation's negatives. Only a **numerically frozen** t=0 threshold catches it.
- **Refit-noise baseline for direction cosine — keep.** No established practice.
  Frame by analogy to the RSA **noise ceiling** (Nili et al. 2014). Expect
  pushback from papers reporting seed-refit cosines ≥0.998 — say plainly that
  optimizer-seed stability and data-resampling stability are different baselines.

## Revised spine

1. **Setting**: a correctness probe as the *positive* RL reward — no evasion
   incentive, pure Goodhart. Distinguishes us from every prior paper, all of
   which use the probe as a penalty.
2. **Headline**: the ~40-step detection window, measured on-policy on held-out
   prompts, against Baker et al.'s conflation.
3. **Mechanism**: the completed 2×2 including the unclaimed fourth cell, reported
   with its ruler named (AUROC-scale; the split runs +46% on Youden's J and
   −266% on TPR) and its interaction term explicit.
4. **Methodological**: frozen-threshold TPR (every ROC-family metric, including
   the field-standard TPR@1%FPR, is equally invariant to monotone recalibration);
   the refit-noise baseline for direction drift (an RSA *noise ceiling* by
   analogy); variance-matched residualisation controls (Elazar et al.'s canonical
   control is count-matched, and they flagged the gap as future work in 2021).

**Honest scale**: a workshop paper, not the ICLR submission `CLAUDE.md` targeted.
One seed, one 0.5B model, one task.

## LLM-judge citations added to writeup_judge.tex (2026-08-27)

Both round-4 reviewers flagged the same gap: a submission to a workshop on LLM
judges with zero LLM-judge references. Nine were added. **Every one was fetched
from arxiv.org and its title, authors and quoted figures checked against the
source before it went into the .bib** -- the reviewer that proposed most of them
is itself an LLM, and six of the IDs postdate the assistant's knowledge cutoff,
so they had to be treated as unverified until checked. One proposed figure
(TPR-FPR 0.31 -> 0.09) was absent from the abstract and confirmed only in the
full text's Table 2, where it turns out to describe a three-judge *ensemble*
rather than a single judge; the paper's sentence was narrowed to match.

Two of these cost us novelty and are cited as such rather than buried:
`li2026whodrifted` gives a better version of our one practitioner recommendation,
and `beigi2026prime` already shows internal probes carry early warning. The
surviving claim is narrower and should be stated narrowly: what a monitor's
*own* health statistics do while the policy it watches degrades.
