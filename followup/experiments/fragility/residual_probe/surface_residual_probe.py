"""A probe that cannot read the cheap surface features, for use as an RL reward.

Motivation. The workshop paper's line 179 asks, as an open question, whether a
probe trained to ignore rhetorical scaffolding would still be near-oracle and
would resist confound exploitation under RL. This module builds that probe.

The measured facts it is responding to (all on clean-406, C_outcome):

  - the probe reads more than trace length: AUROC 0.9807 stratified within
    </think>-length deciles, so it is not a length detector;
  - but a large share of its signal is surface-explainable in the broader sense:
    residualising the activations against the full 39-feature battery drops
    held-out AUROC 0.9775 -> 0.8363, and drops the correlation with a pure
    surface model's score from +0.858 to +0.255;

    (39, not 23. The 23-feature figure elsewhere in this project is the subset
    used for the dose-response correlation, where near-constant features were
    dropped because a standardised shift on them explodes. Residualisation uses
    all 39 — dropping a rare feature there would leave its component in the
    activation, which is the opposite of the intent.)
  - and the attacked policy moves exactly those features, in proportion to how
    much correctness signal each one carried.

So the question is whether the 0.836 probe, which is weaker read-only, is
*harder to Goodhart*.

Scoring is `LR(h - s @ B)`, where `h` is the </think> hidden state, `s` is the
z-scored surface feature vector of the same rollout (plus an intercept), and `B`
is the least-squares map from surface features to activations, fit ONCE on the
baseline distribution and frozen.

Two things about that definition that must not be quietly forgotten:

  - `B` is fit on the baseline distribution. Off-distribution — which is exactly
    where the policy goes — `h - s @ B` is no longer a calibrated "surface-free"
    activation. This is a property of the experiment, not a bug, but it bounds
    what a null result would mean.
  - the residualised probe is WEAKER read-only (0.836 vs 0.978). A smaller
    collapse is therefore ambiguous between "less surface coupling helps" and
    "weaker probes collapse less". The surface-model-as-reward positive control
    is what disambiguates; do not run this arm alone and read it as an answer.

The class carries `needs_text = True`. The forked reward builder in
`residual_reward.py` checks that attribute and passes the rollout text; probes
without it are called exactly as before, so the existing reward path is
unchanged.
