"""Rollout labelling, structural-template features, and the global train/val split.

Labels come from the ORIGINAL verifier (`evaluation.countdown`), not a
reimplementation. Two caveats on "the same as the RL reward". The block regex
here uses re.DOTALL and the verifier's extract_solution does not, so the two
disagree on answer blocks that span lines (2 of 2,400 reward-probe fitting
rollouts). And RL sampling stopped at the first "</answer>", so the reward only
ever graded the first block; last_block on an unstopped rollout is not a label
the RL reward ever produced.

Two label rules are always computed and stored side by side:

  first_block  correctness of the FIRST <answer> block. The paper's headline
               probe-AUROC rule (a trace-final hidden state predicts what the
               model is about to commit to).
  last_block   correctness of the LAST <answer> block == `compute_score == 1.0`.
               This is what vanilla RLOO rewards, and it is the rule the
               probe-as-reward pickle was trained on (see
               extension/cache/steering/probe_pipeline_temp1_meta.json).

Which one is the headline for a phase is a CONFIG choice (`label_rule`), fixed
once per phase — never per checkpoint.

The train/val split is a deterministic function of prompt_idx only. That matters
because the on-policy arm resamples rollouts at every checkpoint, so row
identity is not stable across t; prompt identity is. Splitting by prompt also
prevents within-prompt leakage between train and val.
