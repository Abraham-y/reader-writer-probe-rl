# What Happens to a Monitor's Accuracy When You Train Against It

**Abraham Yeung and Anagha Ramaswamy**, Stanford University.
Interpretability as a Science (InterpScience) Workshop, NeurIPS 2026.

Paper: [`writeup_interpscience.pdf`](writeup_interpscience.pdf) (source [`writeup_interpscience.tex`](writeup_interpscience.tex)).

A linear probe on Qwen2.5-0.5B's hidden states predicts whether a Countdown answer
will be correct (held-out AUROC 0.982). A second fit of the same kind, used as the
RL reward, lowers true accuracy by 31 points, and the probe's own AUROC does not
fall for 30 to 40 steps after accuracy starts to. A fixed LLM judge
scoring the same run keeps its AUROC while accuracy falls from 54% to 23%: a
monitor's accuracy statistics describe the monitor together with the population it
scores, and deploying the monitor moves the population. Separately, of three rewards
trained under one recipe, the one that read lowest as a monitor kept the most
accuracy, and a reward built only from 39 text features drove accuracy to exactly
zero. One seed each: these are counterexamples, not a trend.

## Reproducing the paper

Every number, table and figure in the paper regenerates on CPU from 0.36 GB of
cached artifacts (activations, judge scores, rollouts), published as the Hugging
Face dataset [`prismane16/monitor-accuracy-under-rl`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/prismane16/monitor-accuracy-under-rl), which mirrors
this repository's paths:

```bash
python scripts/artifacts.py fetch        # download into place, verify SHA-256
bash scripts/check_everything.sh                         # ~15 min on a laptop
```

`scripts/check_everything.sh` recomputes each published value, prints it beside
the number in the tex, and exits non-zero on any disagreement. `artifacts/MANIFEST.tsv`
lists every artifact with its size and hash; `artifacts/README.md` is the
dataset's card and says what each file is and where the paper uses it.

To rebuild the PDF and its figures:

```bash
python scripts/plot_lag_from_gated.py --out figures/lag.pdf
python scripts/plot_ladder_from_gated.py
pdflatex writeup_interpscience.tex && pdflatex writeup_interpscience.tex
```

Retraining any run needs a GPU; the recipes are in the project history below and
in `followup/experiments/fragility/residual_probe/HANDOFF.md`.

### Running the GPU jobs on Modal

Every training run and large evaluation in the paper ran on [Modal](https://modal.com),
which sponsored the compute, and the deployment code is part of this repository:

| file | what it launches |
|---|---|
| `modal_train.py` | SFT, IPO and the RLOO variants (vanilla, probe-as-reward `probe_rloo`, shaped rewards), sampling (`sample_local`), activation caching and the probe analyses: `modal run modal_train.py <trainer> -- <args>` |
| `followup/modal_fragility.py` | the checkpoint-ladder harvest (`harvest`), the judge ladder (`judge_ladder`), the reward arms A, B and R (`residual_rl`) and their evaluation (`eval_local`) |
| `modal_requirements.txt` | the container's pinned Python environment |
| `{rloo,sft,ipo}_trainer/train_*_modal.sh`, `evaluation/sample_modal.sh` | shell launchers for the base-project runs |

Both apps mount one Modal volume for checkpoints and results
(`MODAL_VOLUME_NAME`, default `default-proj-training`). Credentials are never in
the code: `HF_TOKEN` and `WANDB_API_KEY` are read from the launching shell and
passed to the container as a Modal secret, so export them (for example from a
local `.env`) before `modal run`. Smoke-test with `--num_training_steps 5` before
a full run: `followup/experiments/fragility/residual_probe/HANDOFF.md` lists five
deployment failures, and a 5-step run caught all of them.

### Headline results

Working on Qwen2.5-0.5B (replicated at 1.5B) trained on Countdown arithmetic with RLOO:

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| A trace-final correctness probe is **near-oracle**, and outcome RL strengthens it. | Held-out AUROC `0.912 → 0.982` (0.5B); `0.974` at 1.5B; within-prompt matched-pair Wilcoxon `p < 1e-7`. |
| The probe is **not a length detector**, though length explains a lot. | Stratified within `</think>`-position deciles it holds `0.939`, against `0.564` for position alone. |
| Within multi-answer rollouts, the model's commit-time representation tracks the commit — **no "knows-but-doesn't-say"** at this scale. | On T→F drift rollouts, probe at the wrong-final commit = `0.154` against an F→F floor of `0.088` — a real but small residue (`+0.065`, CI `[+0.023, +0.105]`), only `8.7%` of the way from floor to the T→T level. |
| The probe is a **reader, not a usable write-axis** on the vanilla checkpoint. | Activation-addition steering vs. matched random direction gives Δ ∈ `[-0.07, +0.02]`; no magnitude gives a positive effect, and the one interval excluding zero (α=0.5, Δ = `−0.072`) points the wrong way. |
| As a **deployment selector** the probe is useful at zero extra inference compute — but a structural baseline captures most of it. | Best-of-16 `+11.7 pp` over a random pick of 16 on C_outcome — `88.8%` of all available headroom — of which `+8.5 pp` is available from "pick the rollout with the shortest `<think>` body" with no probe at all; the probe adds `+3.2 pp` (CI `[+0.99, +5.42]`, p = 0.008). Budgeted restart matches best-of-16 at `−60%` compute; abstention `98%` at `50%` coverage. |
| As the **RL reward**, the probe catastrophically Goodharts in both initialisation regimes. | `runA` (init from C_outcome): delayed Goodhart, `−31.4 pp` first-block accuracy (0.550 → 0.236); `runB` (init from C_SFT): immediate Goodhart, `−22 pp`. |
| **A monitor with no internal access reproduces the failure**, and used as the reward it destroys the task. | 7-feature text-only logistic regression, frozen on baseline: score `0.506 → 0.832` while true accuracy falls `0.517 → 0.130`. As the RL reward (pre-registered Arm B): `0.0000` accuracy, with `99.9%` of rollouts still emitting a well-formed but arithmetic-free `<answer>` block. |
| **Safe constructions** that bound or eliminate probe gradient access give either small lifts or no Goodhart — **and none beats read-only selection.** | Probe-as-baseline (LOO control variate): target-invariant, untested. Multiplicative shaping `r = verifier × probe`: `+2.84 pp` first-block, CI `[+1.85, +3.85]`, n=1 run. Probe-best-of-K in-training selection: `+1.5 pp`, halves mean blocks per rollout, n=1 run. Read-only best-of-16: `+11.7 pp`. |

**Withdrawn.** An earlier version of this README claimed a mech-interp signature of Goodhart — the optimised probe direction becoming causal post-RL (Δ = `+0.083`) while a near-orthogonal control stayed null. That result does not survive checking and is retracted: the steered vector has cosine `0.163` with the probe RL actually optimised (not `1.000`) and AUROC `0.896` (not `0.982`), the steering hook sat one transformer block and 2–3 tokens downstream of the probe's read site, the key contrasts reach only p = 0.063 and p = 0.080, and the three steering runs share zero prompts. `causal_steering.py` now fixes both the layer index and the token position, so it will not reproduce the published JSONLs; use `--layer_convention legacy_block --steer_position last_token` if you need to. See `docs/REVISION_PACK.md` §A.

### Reproducing the headline experiments

All training and large evals were run on Modal H100 (single GPU per job). Total project compute spend: **~$265**.

#### 1. SFT and the baseline RL checkpoint

We did not retrain SFT. `C_SFT` is `asingh15/qwen-sft-countdown-defaultproj`. `C_outcome` is 100 RLOO steps from `C_SFT` with the standard verifier reward (`batch_size=128`, `kl=1e-3`, `lr=1e-5`).

```bash
bash rloo_trainer/train_rloo_modal.sh   # 100 steps from C_SFT, verifier reward
```

#### 2. Cache hidden states and train probes

```bash
python extension/probe/cache_hidden_states.py        # pre_answer / assertion / neutral
python extension/probe/cache_answer_positions.py     # <answer>-opening positions
python extension/probe/save_probe_direction_temp1.py # persist L16 pre_answer direction
```

#### 3. Deployment-time applied probes

```bash
python extension/probe/probe_bestofk_offline.py        # best-of-16
python extension/probe/probe_guided_restart.py         # budgeted restart
python extension/probe/probe_abstention_and_hybrid.py  # abstention + majority hybrid
python extension/probe/probe_adaptive_budget.py        # adaptive K_avg
python extension/probe/probe_as_eval_proxy.py          # probe-mean as accuracy estimator
python extension/probe/probe_answer_commit.py          # within-rollout block selector
python extension/probe/probe_applied_scale_comparison.py  # 0.5B vs 1.5B
```

#### 4. Causal steering

Two flags on this script changed on 2026-08-12 and both change the numbers, so read
this before comparing against any shipped JSONL.

- `--steer_position` defaults to `probe_read`: the token containing the *first*
  character of `</think>`, which is where `cache_hidden_states.py` fit the probe.
  The original runs injected at the last token of the prefix, 2-3 positions later.
- `--layer_convention` defaults to `hidden_state`: `--layer 16` means
  `hidden_states[16]`, so the hook goes on `model.layers[15]`. The original runs
  hooked `model.layers[16]`, which writes to `hidden_states[17]` — one full
  transformer block downstream of the read site.

```bash
# The vanilla null (Section 4 of the paper), at the corrected site
python extension/probe/causal_steering.py \
    --model_path <C_outcome>  --steer_vec <C_outcome_l16_pre_answer.npz> \
    --alphas 0.0 0.5 1.0 2.0  --n_prompts 100 --n_rollouts_per_prompt 2

# To reproduce the shipped (withdrawn) post-Goodhart JSONLs bit-for-bit
python extension/probe/causal_steering.py \
    --model_path <runA_final>  --steer_vec <C_outcome_l16_pre_answer.npz> \
    --steer_position last_token --layer_convention legacy_block
```

Analyse with `extension/probe/causal_steering_stats.py`, which does the
prompt-clustered bootstrap and exact McNemar. Note that the vanilla and
post-Goodhart JSONLs share **zero prompts** (50/97 prefixes vs 100/194), so any
before/after contrast across those files is unpaired.

#### 5. Probe-as-RL-reward (Goodhart demonstration)

There are two probe-as-reward trainers, and they differ in where the probe
reads its hidden state:

- `extension/training/probe_rloo.py` reads the **current policy's** hidden state
  at `</think>` (a reference copy reloaded from the newest checkpoint each round).
  This is what trained **runA** and **runB**, via `modal run modal_train.py probe_rloo -- ...`.
- `extension/training/probe_reward_rloo.py` reads a **frozen** model's hidden
  state (C_SFT by default), so its reward is a fixed function of the text. The
  pre-registered **arms A and B** used this one, via
  `followup/modal_fragility.py residual_rl` (see
  `followup/experiments/fragility/residual_probe/HANDOFF.md`).

runA and runB were trained on 2026-06-02 (code at `613aef2`) with these
settings, read from their W&B configs (`rloo_probe_0.5b/probe_rloo_run{A,B}_*_FINAL`):
`--probe_pkl extension/cache/steering/probe_pipeline_C_outcome_l16_pre_answer_temp1.pkl`,
`--model_name` and `--ref_model_name` C_outcome (runA) or
`asingh15/qwen-sft-countdown-defaultproj` (runB), 100 steps, batch 128, group 8,
grad-accum 128, lr 1e-5 constant, warmup 0, KL 1e-3, entropy 1e-3,
weight decay 0.01, gradient clipping 1.0, temperature 1.0, top-p 1, top-k -1,
max tokens 1024, save every 10 steps. They differ from C_outcome's own run
(group 16, weight decay 1e-4, no clipping) and from the arms (weight decay 1e-4,
no clipping). Training was not seeded.

Two things about reproducing runA/runB from the current code:

- `--probe_pkl` is now required. Its old default was the T=0.6 first-block probe,
  not the reward probe, and the flag was not recorded at the time; that runA/runB
  used the temperature-1 probe was confirmed afterwards by recomputing runB's
  logged step-0 rewards.
- The current `probe_rloo.py` reloads the reference model correctly on every
  step. At `613aef2` it looked only for `latest_checkpoint`, so on the step after
  each saved checkpoint (steps 1, 11, 21, ...) the probe read weights one update
  old. The fix (`a73042f`) came after the runs, so the current code will not
  reproduce them bit for bit.

#### 6. Probe-best-of-K in-training selection (the hybrid that beats vanilla RLOO)

Top-M gating lives on `rloo.py` and requires `--probe_baseline`:

```bash
python rloo_trainer/rloo.py \
    --model_name asingh15/qwen-sft-countdown-defaultproj \
    --group_size 8 --probe_baseline --probe_topk_M 4 \
    --probe_value_pkl extension/cache/steering/probe_pipeline_C_outcome_l16_pre_answer_temp1.pkl
```

Add `--probe_topk_renormalize` to rescale the surviving advantages by
`group_size / M`. Without it the top-M arm trains at roughly `M/group_size` of
vanilla RLOO's effective learning rate, so a top-M-vs-vanilla comparison at
matched `--learning_rate` is partly a comparison of step sizes. The flag
defaults off so the original runs reproduce.

The lambda-mix control-variate wrapper is separate:

```bash
python extension/training/probe_augmented_rloo.py --lambda_mix 0.5 \
    --model_name asingh15/qwen-sft-countdown-defaultproj
```

#### 6b. Structural controls (run these before quoting any probe number)

```bash
python extension/probe/structural_baselines.py
```

Reports, on the same folds and population as the probe: the AUROC of the
`</think>` token position alone, the probe's AUROC stratified within
position deciles, best-of-K for "pick the shortest `<think>` body" next to
probe-best-of-K, and the size/accuracy of the no-`</think>` rollouts that are
absent from every cached AUROC. See `docs/CODE_AUDIT.md` §C1.

#### 7. Probe-as-baseline (target-invariant LOO control variate)

The `--probe_baseline` flag in `rloo_trainer/rloo_update_worker.py` replaces the standard reward-mean baseline with the LOO mean of per-rollout probe values. The optimisation target remains the verifier; the probe enters only through the variance-reduction baseline. This construction is code-complete and theoretically Goodhart-free; the controlled run-time comparison against vanilla RLOO is the obvious next experiment and not in the report.

---

### What this repository does *not* contain

- Trained checkpoints, cached activations, and large eval JSONs (>5 MB). Reproduce with the scripts above.
- The probe-as-baseline empirical results; see the report's "Failed Attempts and Null Results" section — the construction is code-complete but a controlled run-time comparison is out of scope.
